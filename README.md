# Calculating group-wise weighted SDP scores

 This code implements group-conservation-weighted SDP scoring, as described in:
   
   Sloutsky R, Naegle KM (2016) High-Resolution Identification of Specificity
   Determining Positions in the LacI Protein Family Using Ensembles of
   Sub-Sampled Alignments. PLoS ONE 11(9): e0162579.
 
 The un-weighted version of this scoring formula was originally described in:
   
   Capra JA and Singh M. (2008) Characterization and Prediction of
   Residues Determining Protein Functional Specificity. Bioinformatics,
   24(13): 1473-1480, 2008.
